This my practice walkthrough of the Microsoft.Net MVC tutorial, with comments.<br>
The tutorial can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio).<br>
I've used books instead of movies, but the framework is the same.
